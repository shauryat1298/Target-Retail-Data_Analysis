# Target Retail Data Analysis
 I analyzed a dataset from Target retail stores in the United States and created visualizations, such as charts and graphs, to gain insights from the sales data.

## Installation

- Python versions 3.*.
- Python Libraries:
    - sklearn.
    - Pandas.
    - numpy.
    - seaborn
    - matplotlib.
    - datetime

## Project Motivation
**In this project we focused retail analysis with Target data and answer the following questions:**
1. Which store had the highest and lowest sales?

![]()

2. Which store had the highest standard deviation in sales, and what was the coefficient of mean to standard deviation?

The store has maximum standard deviation is 14 with $317570

![]()

3. Which store(s) had the best quarterly growth rate in Q3'2012?



4. Which holidays had higher sales than the mean sales during non-holiday seasons for all stores?
5. Can we provide a monthly and semester view of sales in units and identify any trends or patterns?
6. Can we use the available data to build a model to forecast demand in the future?

We have used two different models- Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression
