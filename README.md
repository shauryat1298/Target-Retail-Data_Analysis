# Target Retail Data Analysis
 I analyzed a dataset from Target retail stores in the United States and created visualizations, such as charts and graphs, to gain insights from the sales data.

## Installation

- Python Libraries:
    - sklearn.
    - Pandas.
    - numpy.
    - seaborn
    - matplotlib.
    - datetime

## Project Motivation
**In this project we focused retail analysis with Target data and answer the following questions:**
1. Which store had the highest and lowest sales?

2. Which store had the highest standard deviation in sales, and what was the coefficient of mean to standard deviation?

The store has maximum standard deviation is 14 with $317570

3. Which store(s) had the best quarterly growth rate in Q3'2012?

5. Can we provide a monthly and semester view of sales in units and identify any trends or patterns?

6. Can we use the available data to build a model to forecast demand in the future?

We have used two different models- Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression
